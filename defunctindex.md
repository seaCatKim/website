title: How it works
---

We run monthly skill sharing tutorial sessions, where a member will share something they have learned. 
This is usually on the last thursday of each month. 

**Upcoming event**

The next workshop will form part of the [ResBaz](https://resbaz.github.io/resbaz2021qld/) festival.

A low cost skill- and community-building festival where researchers come together to upskill in digital research tools and scholarship.


It will be presented by Dr Catherine Kim.

**Bio** Catherine completed her PhD in Biological Sciences at UQ earlier this year and now splits her time between research and teaching R at the Library. Her research is focuses on coral reef ecology and conservation and is continually developing her R and data science skills. 

**Workshop description** Grassroots communities of practice are a great way to build communities and skill share â€“ creating an online presence and repository for knowledge, tutorials, and code can be a useful tool. We will introduce a workflow using Git and R to run a community of practice blog by forking a GitHub repository, creating a blogpost in R, and pushing the post back to GitHub. This workshop will feature the UQ Geospatial Analysis Community Group and use their new community of practice R blog as an example. Basic understanding of Git + GitHub and R + RStudio is helpful but the workshop will be aimed for beginners with no prior knowledge.
