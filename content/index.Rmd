**Bio** Catherine completed her PhD in Biological Sciences at UQ earlier this year and now splits her time between research and teaching R at the Library. Her research is focuses on coral reef ecology and conservation and is continually developing her R and data science skills. 

**Workshop description** For this session, Catherine will show us how the new UQ geospatial community of practice blog will operate. She will introduce a workflow using Git and R to run the blog by forking a GitHub repository, creating a blogpost in R, and pushing the post back to GitHub. Basic understanding of Git + GitHub and R + RStudio is helpful but the workshop will be aimed for beginners with no prior knowledge. 

**When** Thursday 25th November 2021, 2:30 - 4:30pm
