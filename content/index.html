<p><strong>Bio</strong> Catherine completed her PhD in Biological Sciences at UQ earlier this year and now splits her time between research and teaching R at the Library. Her research is focuses on coral reef ecology and conservation and is continually developing her R and data science skills.</p>
<p><strong>Workshop description</strong> For this session, Catherine will show us how the new UQ geospatial community of practice blog will operate. She will introduce a workflow using Git and R to run the blog by forking a GitHub repository, creating a blogpost in R, and pushing the post back to GitHub. Basic understanding of Git + GitHub and R + RStudio is helpful but the workshop will be aimed for beginners with no prior knowledge.</p>
