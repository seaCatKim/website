What we will cover:

1. Git and GitHub basics
2. Rmarkdown basics
3. blogdown basics
4. How to create a post on the UQGSAC blogdown website 

### Git

A version control software useful for collaborating on and sharing code.

Git is the software itself and there are several platforms that are like online repositories that work with Git: Bitbucket, GitLab, and GitHub to name a few.

#### Terminology

repository 
pull
push
stage
commit
fork
clone
fetch
main
remote
origin

### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. 

File types:

.md - markdown  
.Rmd - R markdown -> rendered to .html using Pandoc  
.Rmarkdown - also R markdown -> compiled to .markdown documents

### Formatting

Can **bold** and *italicize* text.

Make lists:

* one
* two
* three

Ordered lists:

1. lists
2. need spaces
3. before and after

For a return to start a new line, leave **two spaces** at the end of the line.  
Test.


### Including code

You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

There is also inline code: The mean of speed in the cars data set is `r mean(cars$speed)`.



### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```


## How to create a post

Git stuff:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone the repo in a new RStudio project
3. Use blogdown::new_post() in the console to create a new post
